# ConcentrationGame

ConcentrationGame is an interactive iOS game application. The game is developed using MVC pattern (as all iOS applications are) and contains:

Given 6 pairs of cards, the user will be allowed to flip each card. After flipping a pair, those 2 cards wil be compared. If they are same, then they are removed from the set. Else, the cards are flipped back and remain at their position. The game is that the user has to "concentrate" which cards were at which position so that user is able to match a card if they have already seen the position of the same card. The aim is to match all 6 pairs and get them removed from the set. Each unsuccesfull match leads to a penalty. Users can keep track of numbers of flips using a given flip counter and they lose if they reach a specified number of flips.
